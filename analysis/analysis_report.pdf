# Analysis_report for Lab1: Process Creation and Memory Performance Analysis

To view the performance_chart.png, you will need to use somthing like fastX to see it from folder view and locate the png file respectivily. The image shows that malloc on average takes less time than alloca for allocation sizes less then 2^17. But after 2^17 alloca on average takes less time then malloc. Alloca also maitains a linear progression respective to the allocation size.

	This lab took me approximatilly 12-15 hours to complete including time for troubleshooting researching, planning, and writing down the code. And then about 1-2 hours of revisions and commenting throughout the files. I did have to use AI including chatGPT and Gemini for some parts of the code inorder to get a template or to help in the troubleshooting process. I used promts such as..."Tell me what this part of the assignment discription is asking me to do" or "Tell me what this specific error means and how would I be able to fix it", etc.

	Alloca is for Stack allocation and malloc is for Heap allocation. The stack is a fixed region of memory reserved for each thread and therfore it is extreamley fast. Memory is freed as soon as the function that allocated it returns. But the stack is much smaller and so large allocations risk stack overflow. This was a big issue for me where I would consistantly get segmentation fault(core dumped) when running "./memory_perf". Heap is sloweras it requires bookkeeping and is controlled manually. You have to malloc to allocate and must explicitly free to release it. But the heap is much larger then the stack so one can allocate much bigger blocks. Overall Alloca is best used from small shortlived temp buffers in functions while malloc is best for data that needs to remain beyond the scope of a function or data.
